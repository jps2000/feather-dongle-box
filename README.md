# feather-dongle-box
Box for Adafruit feather nrf52 board to be used as a dongle (with permanently connected cable)
Using a feather nrf52832 board as a dongle requires a box where a micro usb connector is included
It consist of a bottom and a cover part.
4 screws (countersunk  2.2 x 10mm ) are used to close the box 
The cabinet covers also the micro USB connector.  Cables are available in various executions
Here I used a version with a 3mm cable. In case the connector is shorter a cable tie can be attached inside as pull relief of the connector
Can be printed in PLA or ABS. Transparent materials give access to LEDs.
Drilling the holes for the screws with 1.5mm ~ 1.8 mm is recommended before inserting the screws the first time.
