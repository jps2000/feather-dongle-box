# feather-dongle-box
Box for Adafruit feather nrf52 board to be used as a dongle (with permanently connected cable)
Using a feather nrf52832 board as a dongle requires a box where a micro usb connector is included
It consist of a bottom and a cover part.
4 screws (countersunk  2.2 x 10mm ) are used to close the box 
The cabinet covers also the micro USB connector.  Cables are available in various executions
Here I used a version with a 3mm cable. In case the connector is shorter a cable tie can be attached inside as pull relief of the connector
